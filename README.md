9. Expected Output
### Summary:
##### The Spring application is structured to manage employee details.
##### EmployeeDTO holds employee data.
##### EmployeeRepositoryImpl provides the actual data manipulation methods (inserting, removing, and fetching employees).
##### EmployeeServiceImpl interacts with the repository to offer a higher-level service.
##### Spring configuration (AppConfig) defines the beans for the service and repository, and constructor-based dependency injection is used.
